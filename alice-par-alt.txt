To illustrate the professional practice with the business phone the different steps within the app are described in more detail.

The caregivers have to log in with their account in order to use the MediFox app.

They can then choose between several menu options like ‘tasks’, ‘shifts’, ‘handover report’, and ‘messages’.

The option ‘tasks’ is unused entirely and the messaging system is ignored in favor of direct phone calls with a care manager in case questions arise on site.

The options ‘handover report’ and ‘shifts’ are used daily after manually synchronizing the app after the login.

To start their work time caregivers have to start their shift by clicking a green button at the bottom screen.

It triggers a ten minute timer to prepare the tour and, for example, pack necessary medicines and keys.

They can then start their tour by clicking again on a green button.

The app will display the assignments planned for the shift in chronological order and the most important information.

By selecting the patient’s assignment all information about the services, medication, previous vital signs, and the nursing process is accessible.

When arriving at the patient’s apartment, the actual care time recording is started through another click of a green button.

All provided services have to be checked off separately by the caregiver during this step.

As mentioned earlier they can add services if needed due to pre-placement, modification, or urgent assistance.
This never happened during this field stay of the author.

Instead, caregivers used the note function so that the office workers could classify the performed services accordingly afterwards.

The reason mentioned by caregivers was that they are not very familiar with the legal requirements and numbers assigned.

The recording is manually stopped through a red button at the bottom screen once everything has been done at the patient’s home.
The same applies to ending the tour and the caregiver’s shift.
